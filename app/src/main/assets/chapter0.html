        <h2><strong>Java Building Blocks&nbsp;</strong></h2>
</CENTER>
<p class="p1">In this chapter, you studied that Java classes consist of members called fields and
    methods. An<br/>object is an instance of a Java class. There are three styles of comment: a
    single-line comment<br/><strong>(//)</strong>, a multiline comment <strong>(/* */)</strong>, and
    a Javadoc comment <strong>(/** */)</strong>.<br/>Java begins program execution with a <strong>main()</strong>
    method. The most common signature for<br/>this method run from the command line is <strong>public
        static void main(String[] args)</strong>.<br/>Arguments are passed in after the class name,
    as in <strong>Java NameOfClass firstArgument</strong>.<br/>Arguments are indexed starting with
    0.</p>
<p class="p1">Java code is organised into folders called packages. To reference classes in other
    packages,<br/>you use an import statement. A wildcard ending an import statement means you
    want<br/>to import all classes in that package. It does not include packages that are inside
    that one.<br/>java.lang is a special package that does not need to be imported.</p>
<p class="p1">Constructors create Java objects. A constructor is a method matching the class name
    and<br/>omitting the return type. When an object is instantiated, fields and blocks of code
    are<br/>initialized first. Then the constructor is run.</p>
<p class="p1">Primitive types are the basic building blocks of Java types. They are assembled
    into<br/>reference types. Reference types can have methods and be assigned to null. In addition
    to<br/>&ldquo;normal&rdquo; numbers, numeric literals are allowed to begin with <strong>0
        (octal), 0x (hex), 0X (hex),</strong><br/><strong>0b (binary), or 0B (binary)</strong>.</p>
<p class="p1">Numeric literals are also allowed to contain underscores as long<br/>as they are
    directly between two other numbers.<br/>Declaring a variable involves stating the data type and
    giving the variable a name.<br/>Variables that represent fields in a class are automatically
    initialized to their corresponding<br/>&ldquo;zero&rdquo; or <strong>null</strong> value during
    object instantiation. Local variables must be specifically<br/>initialized. Identifiers may
    contain letters, numbers, <strong>$, or _. Identifiers</strong> may not begin with<br/>numbers.
</p>
<p class="p1">Scope refers to that portion of code where a variable can be accessed. There are three<br/>kinds
    of variables in Java, depending on their scope: instance variables, class variables, and local
    variables. Instance variables are the nonstatic fields of your class. Class variables are<br/>the
    static fields within a class. Local variables are declared within a method.</p>
<p class="p1">For some class elements, order matters within the file. The package statement comes
    first<br/>if present. Then comes the import statements if present. Then comes the class
    declaration.<br/>Fields and methods are allowed to be in any order within the class.<br/>Garbage
    collection is responsible for removing objects from memory when they can<br/>never be used
    again. An object becomes eligible for garbage collection when there are no<br/>more references
    to it or its references have all gone out of scope. The <strong>finalize() </strong>method<br/>will
    run once for each object if/when it is first garbage collected.<br/>Java code is
    object-oriented, meaning all code is defined in classes. Access modifiers<br/>allow classes to
    encapsulate data. Java is platform independent, compiling to bytecode. It is<br/>robust and
    simple by not providing pointers or operator overloading. Finally, Java is secure<br/>because it
    runs inside a virtual machine.</p>
