</CENTER>
<p>This chapter took the basic class structure presented in Chapter 4 and expanded it by introducing
    the notion of inheritance. Java classes follow a multilevel <strong>single-inheritance</strong>
    pattern in which every class has exactly one direct parent class, with all classes eventually
    inheriting from <strong>java.lang.Object.</strong> Java interfaces simulate a limited form of
    multiple <strong>inheritance</strong>, since Java classes may implement multiple
    interfaces.<br/>Inheriting a class gives you access to all of the public and protected methods
    of the class, but special rules for constructors and overriding methods must be followed or the
    code will not compile. For example, if the parent class doesn&rsquo;t include a no-argument
    constructor, an explicit call to a parent constructor must be provided in the child&rsquo;s
    constructors.<br/>Pay close attention to the exam to any class that defines a constructor with
    arguments and doesn&rsquo;t define a no-argument constructor.<br/>This Chapter reviewed <strong>overloaded</strong>,
    <strong>overridden</strong>, and<strong> hidden methods</strong> and showed how they
    differ,<br/>especially in terms of <strong>polymorphism</strong>. and also introduced the notion
    of <strong>hiding variables</strong>, although the chapter strongly discourages this in practice
    as it often leads to confusing, difficult to maintain code.<br/>The chapter introduced <strong>abstract
        classes</strong> and <strong>interfaces</strong> and showed how you can use them to define a
    platform for other developers to interact with. By definition, an abstract type cannot be
    instantiated directly and requires a concrete subclass for the code to be used. Since default
    and static interface methods are new to Java 8, expect to see at least one question<br/>on them
    on the exam.</p>
