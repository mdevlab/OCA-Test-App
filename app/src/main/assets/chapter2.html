<p>In this chapter, you learned that Strings are immutable sequences of characters. The new operator
    is optional. The concatenation <strong>operator (+)</strong> creates a new String with the
    content of the first String followed by the content of the second String. If either operand
    involved in the + expression is a String, concatenation is used; otherwise, addition is used.
    <br/>String literals are stored in the string pool. The String class has many methods. You need
    to know <strong>charAt()</strong>, <strong>concat()</strong>, <strong>endsWith()</strong>,
    <strong>equals()</strong>, <strong>equalsIgnoreCase()</strong>,<strong> indexOf()</strong>,
    <strong>length()</strong>, <strong>replace()</strong>, <strong>startsWith()</strong>, <strong>substring()</strong>,
    <strong>toLowerCase()</strong>, <strong>toUpperCase()</strong>, and <strong>trim()</strong>.</p>
<p>StringBuilders are mutable sequences of characters. Most of the methods return a reference to the
    current object to allow method chaining. The StringBuilder class has many methods. You need to
    know <strong>append()</strong>, <strong>charAt()</strong>, <strong>delete()</strong>, <strong>deleteCharAt()</strong>,<strong>
        indexOf()</strong>, <strong>insert()</strong>, <strong>length()</strong>,
    <strong>reverse()</strong>, <strong>substring()</strong>, and <strong>toString()</strong>.
    StringBuffer is the same as StringBuilder except that it is thread safe.</p>
<p>Calling<strong> ==</strong> on String objects will check whether they point to the same object in
    the pool. Calling <strong>==</strong> on StringBuilder references will check whether they are
    pointing to the same StringBuilder object. Calling<strong> equals()</strong> on String objects
    will check whether the sequence of characters is the same. Calling<strong> equals()</strong> on
    StringBuilder objects will check whether they are pointing to the same object rather than
    looking at the values inside.<br/>An array is a <strong>fixed-size</strong> area of memory on
    the heap that has space for primitives or pointers to objects. You specify the size when
    creating <strong>it&mdash;for example, int[] a = new int[6]</strong>;. Indexes begin with 0 and
    elements are referred to using a[0]. The <strong>Arrays.sort()</strong> method sorts an array.
    <strong>Arrays.binarySearch()</strong> searches a sorted array and returns the index of a match.
    If no match is found, it negates the position where the element would need to be inserted and
    subtracts 1. Methods that are passed <strong>varargs (&hellip;)</strong> can be used as if a
    normal array was passed in. In a multidimensional array, the second-level arrays and beyond can
    be different sizes.</p>
<p>An ArrayList can change size over its life. It can be stored in an ArrayList or List reference.
    Generics can specify the type that goes in the ArrayList. You need to know the methods <strong>add()</strong>,
    <strong>clear()</strong>, <strong>contains()</strong>, <strong>equals()</strong>, <strong>isEmpty()</strong>,
    <strong>remove()</strong>,<strong> set()</strong>, and <strong>size()</strong>. <br/>Although an
    ArrayList is not allowed to contain primitives, Java will <strong>autobox</strong> parameters
    passed into the proper wrapper type. <strong>Collections.sort()</strong> sorts an <strong>ArrayList</strong>.<br/>A
    LocalDate contains just a date, a LocalTime contains just a time, and a LocalDateTime contains
    both a date and time. All three have private constructors and are created using <strong>LocalDate.now()</strong>
    or <strong>LocalDate.of()</strong> (or the equivalents for that class). Dates and times can be
    manipulated using <strong>plusXXX</strong> or <strong>minusXXX</strong> methods. The Period
    class represents a number of days, months, or years to add or subtract from a
    <strong>LocalDate</strong> or <strong>LocalDateTime</strong>.<br/>DateTimeFormatter is used to
    output dates and times in the desired format. The date and time classes are all immutable, which
    means the return value must be used.</p>
