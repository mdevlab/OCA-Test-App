        <h2><strong>Operators and Statements&nbsp;</strong></h2>
</CENTER>
<p>This chapter cover a wide variety of topics, including dozens of Java operators, along<br/>with
    numerous control flow statements. Many of these operators and statements may have<br/>been new
    to you.</p>
<p>It is important that you understand how to use all of the required Java operators covered in this
    chapter and know how operator precedence influences the way a particular expression is
    interpreted. There will likely be numerous questions on the exam that appear to test one thing,
    such as <strong>StringBuilder</strong> or exception handling, when in fact the answer is related
    to the misuse of a particular operator that causes the application to fail to compile. When you
    see an operator on the exam, always check that the appropriate data types are used and<br/>that
    they match each other where applicable.</p>
<p>For statements, this chapter covered two types of control structures: decision-making controls
    structures, including <strong>if-then</strong>, <strong>if-then-else</strong>, and <strong>switch
        statements</strong>, as well as repetition control structures including <strong>for</strong>,
    <strong>for-each</strong>,<strong> while</strong>, and do-while. Remember that most of these
    structures require the evaluation of a particular boolean expression either for branching
    decisions or once per repetition. The switch statement is the only one that supports a variety
    of data types, including String variables as of Java 7.</p>
<p>With a for-each statement you don&rsquo;t need to explicitly write a boolean expression, since
    the compiler builds them implicitly. For clarity, we referred to an enhanced for loop as a
    for-each loop, but syntactically they are written as a for statement.</p>
<p>We concluded this chapter by discussing advanced control options and how flow can be enhanced
    through nested loops, break statements, and continue statements. Be wary of questions on the
    exam that use nested statements, especially ones with labels, and verify they are being used
    correctly.</p>
<p>This chapter is especially important because at least one component of this chapter will likely
    appear in every exam question with sample code. Many of the questions on the exam focus on
    proper syntactic use of the structures, as they will be a large source of questions<br/>that end
    in &ldquo;Does not compile.&rdquo; You should be able to answer all of the review questions
    correctly or fully understand those that you answered incorrectly before moving on to later<br/>chapters.
