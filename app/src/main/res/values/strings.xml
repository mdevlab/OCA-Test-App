    <string name="dummy_explanation">A. Line 4 instantiates an Order. Java runs the declarations and instance initializers first
in the order they appear. This sets value to tacf. Line 5 creates another Order and
initializes value to tacb. The object on line 5 is stored in the same variable line 4 used.
This makes the object created on line 4 unreachable. When value is printed, it is the
instance variable in the object created on line 5.</string>
